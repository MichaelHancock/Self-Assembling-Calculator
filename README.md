# Self Assembling Calculator

A University project which takes an input and output and assembles a function based on these values in [dana](https://www.projectdana.com/). The target function should be able to transform the input into the output.

This repository includes the three approaches attempted

1. [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/MichaelHancock/Self-Assembling-Calculator/tree/Genetic-Algorithm-Function-Generation)
2. [Incremental Brute Force](https://github.com/MichaelHancock/Self-Assembling-Calculator/tree/Incremental-Elimination-of-Functions)
3. [Random Selection](https://github.com/MichaelHancock/Self-Assembling-Calculator/tree/Random-Function-Generation)

The guided approach of a genetic algorithm outperformed both a randomly assembled function and one assembled by enumerating all possible operations.

[Here is an example](https://github.com/MichaelHancock/Self-Assembling-Calculator/blob/Genetic-Algorithm-Function-Generation/Self%20Assembling%20Calculator/Resources/calculator.dn) function generated by the genetic algorithm.
